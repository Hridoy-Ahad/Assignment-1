Rainfall in Bangladesh in Year:2017 & 2018
</h3>

<p>
Bangladesh extends from N20�34' to N26�38' latitude and from E88�01' to E92�41'
longitude which lies in the tropical monsoon region and the climate is characterised by high
temperature, heavy rainfall, often excessive humidity, and fairly marked seasonal variations.
Bangladesh enjoys generally a sub-tropical monsoon climate. While there are six seasons in a
year, three namely, winter, summer and monsoon are prominent. Winter, which is quite pleasant,
begins in November and ends in February. The summer starts from March and extended up to
May. Monsoon starts in June and stays up to September.

<h3>
Background 
</h3>


<p>
Surface Water Processing Branch do entry, process & send data to the data base server after
receiving all data collected by field hydrological divisions. After receiving data from field
offices check validation and published report is also a major activity of processing branch. Due
to manpower shortage, there is a long gap to publish such type of report. In this study we
analyzed rainfall data for the year 2017 & 2018 and findings are discussed in this report.

<h3>
Required Data 

</h3>

<p>
Water occurs on the earth in all its three stages, viz, liquid, solid, & gaseous and in various
degree of motion. Most of the water in our country comes through the cross boundary rivers and
another major portion of water comes from rainfall. In this study Rainfall data for the year 2017
& 2018 are analysed. 
</p>


<h3>
Sources of Data
</h3>

<p>
3 Sources of Data
Field offices under Chief Engineer, Hydrology of Bangladesh Water Development Board
(BWDB) collect, process and store the Hydrological Data of Bangladesh. BWDB maintains a
strong hydrologic network throughout the country for the collection of different hydrological
data. Rainfall and Evaporation data are collected on daily basis. Data collected from the fields are
processed and stored in the database maintained by Processing Circle of BWDB. All the data
used in this study are extracted from central database of BWDB.

Summary of rainfall
in Bangladesh for the Year 2017 & 2018
</h2>

<h3>
1.Rainfall Volume and Statistics
</h3>

<p>
Monthly Rainfall Volume has been estimated all the available rainfall data in BWDB for the
year of 2017 & 2018. The rainfall volume has been calculated as the product of annual average
rainfall and the district area, then presented it in Million m3
. It has been found that on average
maximum rainfall occurs during the year 2017 at Sylhet & Cox�s Bazar district and during the
year 2018 at Cox�s Bazar & Sunamganj District.
</p>


<h3>
2.Rainfall Volume for the year 2017 & 2018
</h3>

<p>
Annual average Rainfall in the country during the year 2017 is 2656 mm, which is
equivalent to a depth of 2.77m. Annual average Rainfall in the country during the year 2018 is
1796 mm, which is equivalent to a depth of 1.84m.

The calculated & statistical value of Seasonal & annual average rainfall (mm) distribution of 64
Districts and monthly & annual total rainfall (mm) in the year 2017 & 2018
